          <p style="text-align: center;">Maharashtra (Marathi: महाराष्ट्र) in Western India is the third-largest state of India by size and the second-largest by population.
            It stretches from the west coast to the interior regions with a variable climate. Maharashtra contains India's most industrialised region, the Mumbai-Pune belt. Agriculturally, too, the state is one of India's more advanced and well-irrigated.
  Maharashtra, state of India, occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan plateau in the western peninsular part of the subcontinent. Its shape roughly resembles a triangle, with the 450-mile (725-km) western coastline forming the base and its interior narrowing to a blunt apex some 500 miles (800 km) to the east. Maharashtra is bounded by the Indian states of Gujarat to the northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the southeast, Karnataka to the south, and Goa to the southwest and by the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and the Arabian Sea to the west.
Maharashtra’s capital, Mumbai (formerly Bombay), is an island city on the western coast, connected to the mainland by roads and railways. Aptly called the gateway of India, Maharashtra is one of India’s biggest commercial and industrial centres, and it has played a significant role in the country’s social and political life. <br> <b>Credits to Britannica</b></p>
